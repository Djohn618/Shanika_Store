          <h2>How It All Started</h2>
          <p>In 2014, Bandu Kumara John Kothalawalage bought a small 5-perch land in Trincomalee (No. 119) near the roundabout. With the help of his wife and a few family members, he built a humble vegetable shop named Shanika Super—after his wife—using wood and coconut leaves.
          The shop had no electricity or water. To power the store, they used a car battery to light three LED bulbs. Despite many struggles, sleepless nights, and tireless hard work, Bandu Kumara and his wife dedicated themselves to growing their small business.</p>
          <br>
          <h2>Growth & Challenges</h2>
          <p>Every two months, Bandu Kumara traveled to Dambulla, a city known for its vegetable and fruit markets. Over time, he expanded his business by selling groceries such as rice, beans, and sugar. As the shop became well-known among locals, the earnings improved, allowing them to bring in electricity and water.
          Determined to make the store permanent, he took a bank loan from People’s Bank—located right in front of the shop—using his wife’s house permit as a guarantee. With this, Shanika Super & Grocery was born, transforming the once-small wooden shop into a thriving local business.</p>
          
          <h2>Giving Back to the Community</h2>
          <p>As the business grew, so did Bandu Kumara’s generosity. He didn’t just keep the profits for himself—he helped those in need by providing food, school supplies, and healthcare assistance. His support extended to various religious communities, including Buddhist, Hindu, Christian, and Muslim organizations.
          However, success also brought challenges—not just friends but also rivals. But through perseverance and kindness, Shanika Super & Grocery continued to thrive.</p>

          <h2>A Decade of Success & A New Chapter</h2>
          <p>More than ten years later, the store is not only serving locals but also supplying major companies and government institutions. In 2019, Bandu Kumara moved to Switzerland with his family, passing the business to his wife’s brother, Nipuna Sadaruwan Alenthuge. Under Nipuna’s leadership, the store has flourished, becoming more popular, more profitable, and in better condition than ever.</p>

          <p>We are more than just a store—we are a family business with a heart. Our mission is to continue serving our community, growing our business, and helping those in need.</p>
